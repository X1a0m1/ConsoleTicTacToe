## About
I'm newbie and this is my simple project to practice coding and work with Git. You can also point out flaws in the code to help me make this code better :D
## Rules
* Two players take turns putting their marks in the empty cells.
* The winner is the one who first scores 3 marks in a row (up, down or diagonally).
* If all 9 squares are filled, but the victory condition is not met, the game ends in a draw.
